As in react sometime the component rerender unnecessary.
Now using callback function we can stop some callback we can control this as to render when state changed.

usememo and usecallback both are used for optimizing the code.

As sometime we have to find the result which is already calculated which is inefficent way.

useMemo() - this stores the result by the technique of memoiozation 
usecallback() - it store the function say that we can calculate the result again.
